A tool to simulate radio interferometric observations based on CASA tool-kit. Works in version CASA 4.7.2. 
It was initially written to simulate GMRT observations and then generalised to simulate observations with any radio telescope.
We have simulated GMRT, Expanded-GMRT, VLA and SKA observations with it.
